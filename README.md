Welcome! 

This is my test book using bookdown and renv. As a developer, these are your following steps:
1. Make updates on your local version.
  - Ensure that packages are all included in the environment (run "renv::snapshot()")
  - Check if things are working with `bookdown::serve_book()'
2. Push changes (ensure that the actions do not fail)
3. Merge with dev
4. PR to main

Upon approval to main PR, the github page will be updated and deployed. Note, the online update may take a few minutes after merge.
