Welcome! 

This is the test version of automating the SCCRU book publishing process. A walkthrough can be found in [app_development.Rmd](app_development.Rmd), or the appropriate section of the appendix. Typically you may walkthrough it on your computer, but you can also view it online (linked to name previously). This can help in setting up GitHub for the first time.

Let me know if you encounter errors or ways we could make the instructions clearer.
